# Patterns of C# and the examples of the most usable

For testing the most popular coding patters in C#:
- Singleton Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Command Pattern (with Prototype)
- Factory Method Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Momento
- Strategy


## Common Design Patterns in C# 4.0 
### Creational Patterns

* Abstract Factory Pattern: Create instances of classes belonging to different families
* Builder Pattern: Separate representation and object construction
* Factory Method Pattern: Create instances of derived classes
* Prototype Pattern: Clone or copy initialized instances
* Singleton Pattern: Class with only one single possible instance

### Structural Patterns

* Adapter Pattern: Match interfaces of classes with different interfaces
* Bridge Pattern:: Separate implementation and object interfaces
* Composite: Simple and composite objects tree
* Decorator: Dynamically add responsibilities to objects
* Facade: Class that represents subclasses and subsystems
* Flyweight: Minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects
* Proxy: Object that represents another object

### Behavioral Patterns

* Chain of Responsibility: Pass requests between command and processing objects within a chain of objects
* Command: Encapsulate a method call as an object containing all necessary information
* Interpreter: Include language elements and evaluate sentences in a given language
* Iterator: Give sequential access to elements in a collection
* Mediator: Encapsulates and simplifies communication between objects
* Momento: Undo modifications and restore an object to its initial state
* Observer: Notify dependent objects of state changes
* State: Change object behavior depending on its state
* Strategy: Encapsulate algorithms within a class and make them interchangeable
* Template Method: Define an algorithm skeleton and delegate algorithm steps to subclasses so that they may be overridden
* Visitor: Add new operations to classes without modifying them
